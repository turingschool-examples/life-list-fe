1. Run `npm start` to start the front-end development server
1. Setup the backend repo following the directions in the repo [here](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/life-list-api)

## Practice

1. Explore this application's UI to see how it works. In order to test an app, you need to know how it functions.
1. Explore this application's codebase to see how things are connected and how data moves throughout the applications.
1. Install a testing library (e.g. Cypress).
